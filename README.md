# Clawdbot in Cloudflare Sandbox

Run [Clawdbot](https://clawd.bot/) personal AI assistant in a Cloudflare Sandbox.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set your Anthropic API key
npx wrangler secret put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Set a gateway token (required for remote access)
npx wrangler secret put CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN

# Deploy
npm run deploy
```

After deploying, open the Control UI with your token:

```
https://your-worker.workers.dev/?token=YOUR_TOKEN
```

Replace `your-worker` with your actual worker subdomain and `YOUR_TOKEN` with the token you set.

**Note:** The first request may take 1-2 minutes while the container starts. You'll also need to [pair your device](#device-pairing-default---recommended-for-production) before you can use the Control UI.

## Authentication

By default, clawdbot uses **device pairing** for authentication. When a new device (browser, CLI, etc.) connects, it must be approved via the admin UI at `/_admin/`.

### Device Pairing (Default - Recommended for Production)

1. A device connects to the gateway
2. The connection is held pending until approved
3. An admin approves the device via `/_admin/`
4. The device is now paired and can connect freely

This is the most secure option as it requires explicit approval for each device.

### Gateway Token (Required)

A gateway token is required to access the Control UI when hosted remotely. Pass it as a query parameter:

```
https://your-worker.workers.dev/?token=YOUR_TOKEN
wss://your-worker.workers.dev/ws?token=YOUR_TOKEN
```

**Note:** Even with a valid token, new devices still require approval via the admin UI at `/_admin/` (see Device Pairing above).

For local development only, set `DEV_MODE=true` in `.dev.vars` to skip Cloudflare Access authentication and enable `allowInsecureAuth` (bypasses device pairing entirely).

## Setting Up the Admin UI

To use the admin UI at `/_admin/` for device management, you need to:
1. Enable Cloudflare Access on your worker
2. Set the Access secrets so the worker can validate JWTs

### 1. Enable Cloudflare Access on workers.dev

The easiest way to protect your worker is using the built-in Cloudflare Access integration for workers.dev:

1. Go to the [Workers & Pages dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages)
2. Select your Worker (e.g., `clawdbot-sandbox`)
3. Go to **Settings** > **Domains & Routes**
4. For `workers.dev`, click **Enable Cloudflare Access**
5. Click **Manage Cloudflare Access** to configure who can access:
   - Add your email address to the allow list
   - Or configure other identity providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
6. Note the **Application Audience (AUD)** tag from the Access application settings

### 2. Set Access Secrets

After enabling Cloudflare Access, set the secrets so the worker can validate JWTs:

```bash
# Your Cloudflare Access team domain (e.g., "myteam.cloudflareaccess.com")
npx wrangler secret put CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN

# The Application Audience (AUD) tag from your Access application
npx wrangler secret put CF_ACCESS_AUD
```

You can find your team domain in the [Zero Trust Dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) under **Settings** > **Custom Pages** (it's the subdomain before `.cloudflareaccess.com`).

### 3. Redeploy

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Now visit `/_admin/` and you'll be prompted to authenticate via Cloudflare Access before accessing the admin UI.

### Alternative: Manual Access Application

If you prefer more control, you can manually create an Access application:

1. Go to [Cloudflare Zero Trust Dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Navigate to **Access** > **Applications**
3. Create a new **Self-hosted** application
4. Set the application domain to your Worker URL (e.g., `clawdbot-sandbox.your-subdomain.workers.dev`)
5. Add paths to protect: `/_admin/*`, `/api/*`, `/debug/*`
6. Configure your desired identity providers (e.g., email OTP, Google, GitHub)
7. Copy the **Application Audience (AUD)** tag and set the secrets as shown above

### Local Development

For local development, create a `.dev.vars` file with:

```bash
DEV_MODE=true               # Skip Cloudflare Access auth + bypass device pairing
DEBUG_ROUTES=true           # Enable /debug/* routes (optional)
```

## Persistent Storage (R2)

By default, clawdbot data (configs, paired devices, conversation history) is lost when the container restarts. To enable persistent storage across sessions, configure R2:

### 1. Create R2 API Token

1. Go to **R2** > **Overview** in the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Click **Manage R2 API Tokens**
3. Create a new token with **Object Read & Write** permissions
4. Select the `clawdbot-data` bucket (created automatically on first deploy)
5. Copy the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**

### 2. Set Secrets

```bash
# R2 Access Key ID
npx wrangler secret put AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

# R2 Secret Access Key
npx wrangler secret put AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

# Your Cloudflare Account ID (found in dashboard URL or R2 overview)
npx wrangler secret put CF_ACCOUNT_ID
```

### How It Works

When R2 credentials are configured:
- The R2 bucket is mounted at `/data/clawdbot` in the container
- Clawdbot uses this directory for all its state via `CLAWDBOT_STATE_DIR`
- All data persists across container restarts and redeployments

Without R2 credentials, clawdbot still works but uses ephemeral storage.

## Admin UI

Access the admin UI at `/_admin/` to:
- **Restart Gateway** - Kill and restart the clawdbot gateway process
- View pending device pairing requests
- Approve devices individually or all at once
- View paired devices

The admin UI requires Cloudflare Access authentication (or `DEV_MODE=true` for local development).

## Debug Endpoints

Debug endpoints are available at `/debug/*` when enabled (requires `DEBUG_ROUTES=true` and Cloudflare Access):

- `GET /debug/processes` - List all container processes
- `GET /debug/logs?id=<process_id>` - Get logs for a specific process
- `GET /debug/version` - Get container and clawdbot version info

## Optional: Chat Channels

### Telegram

```bash
npx wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
npm run deploy
```

### Discord

```bash
npx wrangler secret put DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
npm run deploy
```

### Slack

```bash
npx wrangler secret put SLACK_BOT_TOKEN
npx wrangler secret put SLACK_APP_TOKEN
npm run deploy
```

## All Secrets Reference

| `DEBUG_ROUTES` | No | Set to `true` to enable `/debug/*` routes |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | No | R2 access key for persistent storage |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | No | R2 secret key for persistent storage |
| `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` | No | Cloudflare account ID for R2 |

## Troubleshooting

**Gateway fails to start:** Check `npx wrangler secret list` and `npx wrangler tail`

**Config changes not working:** Edit the `# Build cache bust:` comment in `Dockerfile` and redeploy

**Slow first request:** Cold starts take 1-2 minutes. Subsequent requests are faster.

**R2 not mounting:** Check that all three R2 secrets are set (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `CF_ACCOUNT_ID`). Note: R2 mounting only works in production, not with `wrangler dev`.

**Access denied on admin routes:** Ensure `CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` and `CF_ACCESS_AUD` are set, and that your Cloudflare Access application is configured correctly.
